# Ctrl + Z Counter

## What is this exactly?
Esentially a program which counts the times you undo an action in any drawing, design, modelling, etc. app.
It hooks the keyboard to globally listen to the Ctrl + Z combination, as of right now, without process filtering. 
I... kind of overdid this. You will understand why after you see the list of features.
